# SSearX Web Search Tool

The **SSearX Web Search Tool** is a custom search tool designed for the LangChain framework, allowing users to perform automated Google searches and scrape specific websites for content. This tool can retrieve relevant links, access target websites, and extract content, making it highly useful for tasks that require external web data.

## Features

- **Google Search Integration**: Automates searches on Google and retrieves relevant search results.
- **Website Scraping**: Accesses specific websites and scrapes content directly from the page.
- **Content Summarization**: Provides detailed information from search results or websites based on user queries.
- **Compliance with Legal Restrictions**: Avoids searches or content extraction related to topics prohibited by Brazilian law.
