      "Task Decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This approach is particularly useful in the context of autonomous agents and large language models (LLMs). Here are some key points about Task Decomposition:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: This is a prompting technique that encourages the model to \"think step by step.\" By doing so, it can utilize more computational resources to decompose difficult tasks into simpler ones, making them easier to handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tree of Thoughts**: An extension of CoT, this method explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It decomposes a problem into various thought steps and generates multiple thoughts for each step, creating a tree structure. This can be evaluated using search methods like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Methods of Decomposition**: Task decomposition can be achieved through:\n",
      "   - Simple prompting (e.g., asking for steps to achieve a goal).\n",
      "   - Task-specific instructions (e.g., requesting a story outline for writing).\n",
      "   - Human inputs to guide the decomposition process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Execution**: After decomposition, expert models execute the specific tasks and log the results, allowing for a structured approach to complex problem-solving.\n",
      "\n",
